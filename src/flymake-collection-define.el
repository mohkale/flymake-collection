;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a macro `flymake-collection-define', adapted heavily from
;; [[https://github.com/karlotness/flymake-quickdef/blob/150c5839768a3d32f988f9dc08052978a68f2ad7/flymake-quickdef.el][flymake-quickdef]], to allow streamlined syntax-checker definitions. The
;; intended purpose is to abstract the process creation, management and cleanup
;; for a checker as much as possible, leaving the developer to only have to
;; specify what command to run and how to parse its output.

;; Also in this file you'll find helper macros to parse diagnostics using
;; regexps and simplify JSON processing.
;;
;; `flymake-collection-define-rx' works by defining some regular expressions (one for
;; each severity level of the checker) and then matching each line of the output
;; to a regular expression. Special capture groups have been setup by the parser
;; that should be used by any calling checkers to ensure the correct fields from
;; the output can be parsed. The approach for this was heavily inspired by
;; flychecks :error-parsers feature.
;;
;; `flymake-collection-define' can be used to parse JSON output from the checker into
;; flymake diagnostics. This works by parsing the entire JSON input into a list
;; of diagnostic related data, and then iteratively parsing it into diagnostics.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'flymake)

;;;###autoload
(defvar-local flymake-collection-define--procs nil
  "The local plist of checker processes running in the current buffer.
When a checker process is begun its pushed into this plist and when its
finished its removed and killed. In the very often circumstance where a
new check is begun while an old check is still pending, the old check is
killed and replaced with the new check.")

  "Quickly define a backend function for use with Flymake.
Define a function NAME which is suitable for use with the variable
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'. DOCSTRING if given will become the
docstring of the checker function.

Available Variables
-------------------
Within the body of NAME several macro specific variables will be
made available for use with ERROR-PARSER or COMMAND, and other
optional arguments such as PRE-LET. This includes:
* flymake-collection-source
  The the buffer where the syntax check originally began.
* flymake-collection-temp-file
  A temporary file where the contents of the current buffer were
  written (only if WRITE-TYPE is \\='file)
* flymake-collection-temp-dir
  The dirname of flymake-collection-temp-file.

Body Execution
--------------
The overall execution of the generated function NAME first makes use
of (1) WRITE-TYPE, (2) SOURCE-INPLACE, (3) PRE-LET, and (4) PRE-CHECK.
Then a process is created using (4) COMMAND. Once the process finishes
ERROR-PARSER is called (until it returns nil) to get the next
diagnostic which is then provided to `flymake'. TITLE if provided is
used to suffix the message for each diagnostic.

WRITE-TYPE specifies how the process for a syntax check should recieve
the input. It should one of \\='pipe or \\='file (defaulting to \\='pipe).
When set to \\='file a temporary file will ve created, copying the contents
of the `current-buffer'. The variable flymake-collection-temp-file and
flymake-collection-temp-dir will be bound in the body of NAME and provide
access to this temp-file.
When set to \\='pipe, all of the `current-buffer' will be passed to the
process on its standard input stream after it has begun.

SOURCE-INPLACE determines whether to also create a temporary directory
for a temporary file (when using a WRITE-TYPE of \\='file) or whether to
place the temporary file in the same directory as the file being checked.
This can be useful if the syntax checker also resolves imports or packages
and thus needs to be in the same directory. This is disabled by default
meaning the file is placed in folder in the systems temporary directory.

PRE-LET is a `let*' form that is assigned after any checker agnostic
variables. Place anything you want exposed to everything else in the
checker here.

PRE-CHECK is a Lisp form that will be executed immeadiately before any
pending checker processes are killed and a new process is begun. It can
check conditions to ensure launching the checker program is possible. If
something is wrong it should signal an error.

COMMAND is a Lisp form which evaluates to a list of strings that will be
used to start the checker process. It should be suitable for use as the
:command argument to the `make-process' function.

ERROR-PARSER is a lisp-form that should, each time it is evaluated,
return the next diagnostic from the checker output. The result should be
a value that can be passed to the `flymake-make-diagnostic' function. Once
there are no more diagnostics to parse this form should evaluate to nil.

TEMP-FILE-PREFIX overrides the prefix of temporary file names created by
the checker. This is useful for checker programs that have issues running
on hidden files."

  "`flymake-collection-define' parser using regular expressions.

This macro generates a parser that for each line of output from the
checker process, matches one or more regular expressions and then
converts the result to a valid flymake diagnostic that can be
passed back to `flymake-make-diagnostic'.

REGEXPS should be an alist with the car of each entry being the
severity of the diagnostic it matches (as a symbol that will be
turned into a keyword by this macro) and the cdr should be a
sequence of entries that can be interpreted by the `rx' macro.
To simplify matching specific fields in the parsed output several
helper extensions to `rx' have been defined such as file-name or
line. For a list of these see `flymake-collection-define-parse-rx-constituents'.
The only required fields that MUST be parsed are the line number
and message. If these are ommited the matched diagnostic will be
skipped.

WARN: You should not try to capture any extra fields outside of
the special ones described above. This is because any extra capture
groups are used to associate the severity of the diagnostic to the
regexp that matched it (as a performance improvement).

For an example of this macro in action, see `flymake-collection-pycodestyle'."
