;;; Commentary:

;; flymake-collection is a helper for migrating from flycheck to flymake.
;;
;; This includes the definition of several diagnostic functions, hooks
;; to specify the precedence and preferred order of them and the means
;; to easily configure flymake linting.
;;
;; For more see [[file:README.org][README.org]] or https://github.com/mohkale/flymake-collection.
